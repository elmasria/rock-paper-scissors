## Rock Paper Scissors

The game of **Rock Paper Scissors** is played throughout the world. It dates back to the **Han Dynasty** of ancient *China*, contemporary with the Roman Empire. 
Today it is called **jian dao**, **shi tou**, **bu in China**, **pierre-papier-ciseaux** or **chifoumi** in *France*; **roshambo** in parts of the *U.S*., **taş kağıt makas** in *Turkey*, and **jan-ken-pon** in *Japan*. 
It is the distant ancestor of the type system in the immensely popular **Pokémon** games. 
The game is played competitively; there have been international RPS tournaments — however, it's more commonly used as a playful way of settling disputes, whether in the schoolyard or the barroom.

## How to play

The game has two players. In a single round of the game, each player secretly chooses one of three moves, or "throws" — **rock, paper, or scissors**. 

If both players picked the same move, there is no winner. Otherwise, rock beats scissors; paper beats rock; and scissors beat paper.
